```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(stringr)
```

## Challenge 1

```{r Challenge1, echo=TRUE}
u <- c("stately", "plump", "buck", "mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed")
u
u[seq(from = 1, to = 22, by = 3)]
```

Trying again with the str_split() command
leaving the pattern argument blank (just closed quotation marks) would break it up by character, adding the space broke it up by word. 

```{r Challenge1 take 2, echo=TRUE}
u <- c("Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed")
u
u <- str_split_1(u, " ")
u[seq(from = 1, to = 22, by = 3)]
```
